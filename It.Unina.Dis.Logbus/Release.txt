Logbus-ng Release Notes

SVN trunk
*When activating the Logbus web application from LogbusWebApplication, assemblies referenced
	by plugins' respective assemblies might not get copied. Recommending to install everything
	into GAC, dependencies included
*TLS transport relies, for platform reasons, to TLS 1.0 version, while RFC 5425 requires TLS
	1.2 to be used

version 2.0
*Recommended version of Mono (if applicable): 2.6.7, but the software has been tested with
	Mono 2.8
*Syslog TLS transport: setting ValidateClientCertificate=true causes NotImplementedException
*TLS outbound transport is not to be considered stable

version 1.3.1
*WindowsEventLogListener is not supported
*MulticastUdpReceiver is not supported
*It is recommended to deploy Logbus-ng into the GAC
*FFDA is part of the new Logbus Extensions package, released separately
*UdpLogClientImpl (default) prefers IPv4 over IPv6.
	This is a workaround for computers with virtual network cards that may assign a version 6
	address while the machine is not connected to the IPv6 Internet
*Running a client on a computer with multiple network cards, on some network topologies,
	might prevent the client itself from working
*Clients have no way to tell what are the custom filters available on the server

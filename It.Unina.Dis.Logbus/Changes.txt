Logbus-ng Change Log

SVN trunk
*Major changes in Logger configuration: loggers can have names, and a default logger
	can be specified. If none, ConsoleLogger is assumed. ILog can also refer to a
	user-defined entity
*Default "well-known" logger LogbusLogger, named "Logbus"
*MultiLogger is not supported any more as configuration semantics changed
*LogbusService is no more publicly visible, and the only way to instantiate it as the
	default implementation of ILogBus is through LogbusSingletonHelper. Configuration
	MUST be set prior to this via App.Config or ConfigurationHelper.CoreConfiguration
	property
*All Logbus-related entities can log their major events to the Logbus logger
*Default TTL for UDP outbound transport is 20 seconds
*Added GetAvailableFilters and DescribeFilter methods to ChannelSubscription WSDL
